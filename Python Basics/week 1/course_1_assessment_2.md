Q1.There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called square. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable called xyz the value 5*5 (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with *.<br>

xyz =int( input("Enter number"))<br>
xyz = (xyz*XYZ)<br>
print(XYZ)<br>

Q2.Write code to assign the number of characters in the string rv to a variable num_chars.<br>
rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
    'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;<br>
    Only this and nothing more."""

# Write your code here!<br>
num_chars = len(rv)<br>
print(num_chars)<br>
